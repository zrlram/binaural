# Binarual Experiments

## Play Binaural Beats

Just play the sound

> ./add_binaural.py --hemi-sync

> ./add_binaural.py --beat-frequency 10 --base-frequency 200 

> ./add_binaural.py --hemi-sync --volume 0.5

Play throught the solfeggio frequencies

> ./add_binaural.py --solfeggio --schumann

> ./add_binaural.py --solfeggio --beat-frequency 1


Play as an overlay to audio

> ./add_binaural.py --hemi-sync --audio-file audio.mp3

## Add Binaural Beats to MP3

> ./add_binaural.py --input-file input.mp3 --output-file output.mp3.new --hemi-sync

## Gateway Experience as a Reference

### Common Binaural Frequencies in the Gateway Experience:

1. Delta Waves (0.5-4 Hz):
- Associated with deep relaxation, sleep, and unconscious states.
- Used in tapes to facilitate deep meditative or sleep states.
2. Theta Waves (4-8 Hz):
- Linked to creativity, intuition, and deep meditation.
- Most commonly used in the Gateway tapes to encourage out-of-body experiences (OBEs), vivid imagery, and access to the subconscious.
3. Alpha Waves (8-14 Hz):
- Related to relaxation, calmness, and light meditative states.
- Helps listeners transition from an awake state to a relaxed or meditative state.
4. Gamma Waves (30+ Hz) (Occasionally):
- Associated with higher states of cognitive function and insight.
- Used subtly in higher levels of the Gateway Experience for advanced practices.

### Specific Binaural Beat Frequencies:
The tapes use binaural beats in the Theta range, with frequencies such as:

- 3.5 Hz: Commonly used to induce deep meditation and a gateway into altered states of consciousness.
- 4 Hz: Facilitates access to the subconscious and supports lucid dreaming or OBEs.
- 7.83 Hz (Schumann Resonance): This frequency is said to harmonize with the Earth's magnetic field, aiding grounding and balance.
